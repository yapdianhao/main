== Introduction

JelphaBot is designed for users who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*.
If you *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI), JelphaBot allows you to work fast while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, JelphaBot can help you get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The JelphaBot GUI is designed to allow you to *recognise important tasks at a glance* so that you can prioritise commitments and manage your time.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.
Enjoy!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `jelphabot.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JelphaBot.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`add`**`d/Assignment 1 dt/10-Mar-2020 23 59 m/CS2103T` : adds a task with description `Assignment 1` to the task list.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]

== Features
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/Assignment 1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/Assignment 1 p/0` or as `d/Assignment 1`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/project`, `t/project t/graded` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY`, `p/PRIORITY d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.
====

=== Getting Started
[ Placeholder image for labelled main screen to introduce navigation ]


JelphaBot has four tabs, Task List, Calendar, Productivity and Notes.
You can switch between tabs anytime by pressing `Ctrl + tab` on your keyboard to move to the tab on the right.
If you are already on the rightmost tab, it wraps around to the leftmost tab.

Commands can be entered from the bottom input box.

==== Saving the data

JelphaBot automatically saves your data whenever you make a change. There is no need to save manually.

==== Viewing help : `help`

If you can't recall the command you need, the `help` command opens a help popup window which links to this user guide. +
Format: `help`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

You can exit the program anytime by entering the `exit` command directly from any page. +
Format: `exit`
// no image needed

=== Managing Tasks

JelphaBot allows you to track and manage your tasks. You can view and sort all your tasks from the Task List page.

==== Reading the task list

The task list is formatted so that you can distinguish urgent tasks at first glance. Tasks are tagged according to their importance:

* Default
* *High Priority*
* _Low priority_

Tasks marked as _low priority_ will be _italicized_ to denote optional tasks. +
Tasks are marked as *high priority* will be *bolded* to denote important tasks.

Go to the respective links to find out more  about <<#add, adding>> or <<#edit, editing>> task priority.

The start of every task will be labelled with a module code so that you can visually categorize them.

You can also tag tasks with additional information. To read more about tags, go <<#Tags, here>>

// tag::add[]
==== Adding a task: `add`

Adds a task to the task list. +
Format: `d/DESCRIPTION dt/DATETIME m/MODULE_CODE [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

image::add.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3: Example of an expected result after running `add`_

****
* For dt/DATETIME inputs, we recommend the format MMM-dd-YYYY HH mm, but it also allows some other formats.
// TODO list datetime accepted formats here
* Values that p/PRIORITY can take are -1, 0 or 1. If not specified, DEFAULTS TO 1.
****

[TIP]
A task can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add add d/Assignment 1 dt/Jan-01-2020 23 59 m/CS3230 p/1`
* `add add d/Project TP dt/Jan-01-2020 23 59 m/CS2103T p/1 t/pair work`
